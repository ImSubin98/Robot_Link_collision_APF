The Artificial Potential field is a path planning algorithm
for moving the robot from the initial to the goal point by the
artificial potential field method found by Khatib . It provides
simple and effective motion planners for practical purpose .
The Artificial Potential field algorithm has been examined
by several researchers for various applications such as mobile
robots wheelchair , underwater vehicles , humanoid robots , walking robots , planetary rovers , autonomous sailboat , and bio-fish .
On the other side, quadrotors has become interesting topics
on researches due to its functional uses such as surveillance
robots , autonomous target tracking , bridge
crack detection , object inspection  and autonomous
transportation systems.
